name: Development Workflow Design Conversation
description: Approval-gated feature direction conversation.
---

Discuss the feature direction, intended behavior changes, non-goals, and
framework constraints with the user. Do not write durable artifacts or edit
files. Your conversation should focus on feature outcomes, not implementation
methods. 

Issue context: `gh issue view <number-or-url> --json number,title,body,comments`; body is durable state, comments are context.

Before asking the user questions or requesting approval, run:

```sh
myteam get skill development-workflow/shared/asking-questions
```

Before discussing framework constraints or framework-oriented design decisions,
run:

```sh
myteam get skill development-workflow/shared/framework-oriented-design
```

Potentially relevant starting questions you should ask the user:

- What is the desired outcome of the new feature?
- What changes in behavior do you hope for?
- What behaviors should NOT change?

You should continue the back and forth until the feature is thoroughly understood

Once you have a thorough understanding of the user's intent, you MUST explain
to the user of the feature design you've planned.

## Conclusion

Return `session_id`, `approved`, a concise `summary`, and `next_step`. Use
`design-conversation` until the user explicitly approves, then use
`design-artifact`.
